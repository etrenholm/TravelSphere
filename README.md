## User Story


## Description
Our motivation for this project was to use all the skills we've learned in the past 2 months to make a search application where we can set to-do list for members ina group. As travellers this project made sense to us.
We built this project for groups who loves to travel, and wants a quick way to find places to go in cities they input!
We learned so much during this project as a team, we found out ways to make our hectic schedules work together. We also learned a lot about handlebars, insomnia and how it operates.

## Motivation

	
## Technologies
Project was created using:
* VS Code
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Git
* GitHub
* MySQL
* Sequelize
* Express.js
* Dotenv
* Insomnia
* Handlebars

## Challenges
* GitHub Process
* Working around different schedules and skill levels
* Differences in individual coding processes
* Implementing functionality because it is a little different than the challenge and module project
* Functionality to create a trip and sign up


## Usage
To use our website, simply provide a City in the input, and click search. Upon submitting, Five places will be generated listing total sites, and we can add the to-do lists. Under that list, you will have a read more button to go to the NPS.gov link for that specific city. If you do not enter a city, a modal will pop up prompting you that you must enter one. As you search for cities, a list will be appended underneath the search bar for your search history, you can then click on them to go back to that search. Using the clear button will clear both the list, and your local storage.

## Successes
